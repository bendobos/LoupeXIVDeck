# LoupeXIVDeck

A LoupeDeck plugin for [XIVDeck](https://github.com/KazWolfe/XIVDeck/blob/main/README.md).

> ⚠️ This project currently is "unofficial" and the LoupeDeck pretends to be a Stream Deck in order to interface with the game.
> 
> Keep in mind that this means that this plugin could break anytime something changes inside XIVDeck.

## Features

LoupeXIVDeck supports the same commands as the Stream Deck plugin by @KazWolfe, with some additional adjustments using LoupeDeck's rotary encoders.

* __Text Command__: Run any slash command in-game. 
* __Execute Hotbar Slot__: Execute any hotbar slot.
* __Execute Action__: Execute a supported action (see XIVDeck documentation for more information on what an "action" is).
* __Run In-Game Macro__: Trigger any macro by ID.
* __Switch class__: Switch to a specific class directly.
* __*Rotary Encoder* | Adjust Audio Channel Volume__: Adjust the volume of any audio channel that is available in the game-settings.

## Using the Plugin

Install this plugin via the LoupeDeck software. Also install the XIVDeck Game Plugin as explained on the [XIVDeck Github page](https://github.com/KazWolfe/XIVDeck/blob/main/README.md#installing-the-plugin).

Changing the WebSocket port is currently not supported, so make sure you use the XIVDeck default port.
